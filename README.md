# Prolog-Flix

## Introduction

This project was developped in 2021 to logically show suggestions for films and series, information on new releases as well as customer loyalty information and a satisfaction survey.

## Prolog 

Prolog was created in 1972 at the University of Marseille, France and has become a reference when it comes to programming language focused on artificial intelligence and computational linguistics. This language is declarative, that is, instead of the program stipulating the way to reach the solution step-by-step, as in procedural or object-oriented languages, it provides a description of the problem that is intended to be computed using a collection of facts and rules (logic) that indicate how the proposed problem should be solved.

## Install
